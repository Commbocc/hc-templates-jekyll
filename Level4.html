          <h3>Ready-to-go Adoptions</h3>

          <p> Animals which have completed their "Stray Hold" time and have been spayed/neutered and fully vaccinated are considered "ready-to-go". Any animal in a "ready-to-go" status  can go home with you today. All "ready-to-go" adoptions are $20, unless otherwise noted.</p>

          <h3>Pre-Adoptions</h3>

          <p>Animals that are beyond their hold period that are still waiting to be provided with veterinary services are available for early adoption, but cannot be released to the adopter until the necessary vaccinations and procedures have been administered. We canâ€™t hold or reserve any animal outside of the early adoption process. Pre-adoption prices do not include the $20 rabies license fee.</p>
